# Interconnecting Europe – FASTER as the gateway to the Capital Markets Union

**Warning: This is currently a stub.**

## Development in progress

- We are developing all the modules for FASTER in Elixir (especially the payment chain reconstruction and the eTRC exchange).
distributed hash table to store the certificates of residence
- first real-world application of the EU wallet
- the application wouldn’t be hosted by Divizend, instead it would connect peer-to-peer to the other nodes in the network --> the network itself is fully decentralized, but Divizend would just offer the trusted consulting for it (i.e. like RedHat, but creating our own software which is as influential as Linux, namely this) and be the service provider which brings it into the banks (i.e. Divizend is for this software stack what RedHat does for Linux)
- open source and well-documented

- consider the ISO/OSI layer model: What we are building is a new layer 2 (data link layer)
- essentially a torrent, but only accredited institutions (e.g. the tax office) can upload data into it

## Main cost points for Divizend

- Employees who do due diligence and onboarding at large banks.
- Employees who are programming the integrations into the various core banking systems.

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `faster` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:faster, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/faster>.
